Since we're using the same file for all versions of the json api lab, I've created different branches to make things easier.


<h2>Branches</h2>

* Master: the original branch, now contains, ESModule, asyncAwait, testing, mocking. All the latest stuff. 

* synchronous: the first json api lab

* callback

* promises
