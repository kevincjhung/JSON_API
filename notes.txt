Mocking a database
    test things that interact with the database
    the thing we mock doesnt get tested. 
    basically testing the interaction between the express app and the thing we are testing


esModule
    package.json "type":"module"


express version 5
    if you are using async await for your applications
    right now, use express 5
        npm i express@5.0.0.-beta-1


jestjs.io/docs/mockfunctions

each test should assert 1 logical thing

.toBe() vs .toEqual()
    toBe() checks for exact equality, same memory address location
    toEqual() checks for the same value


.toBeCalledOnce()
    check for accidental loops 


before you re-run a test, make sure you run
   const app = makeApp(mockDatabase)
   
    mockDatabase.getSong.mockReset()
