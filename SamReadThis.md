Since we're using the same file for all versions of the json api lab, I've created different branches to make things easier.
All of the branches were created from files taken from the master branch at some point. 

<h2>Branches</h2>

* Master: the original branch, now contains, ESModule, asyncAwait, testing, mocking. All the latest stuff. 

* synchronous: the first json api lab

* callback

* promises
